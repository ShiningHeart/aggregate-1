# aggregate-1

The aggregate-1 is a general purpose FPGA development platform for designs that require both a large fabric and high speed interconnect. The miniPCIe interface allows operation with most laptops, embedded Small Board Computers and routers. It is particularly suited to security applications.

Hardware
========

• Xilinx Spartan 6 LX150T<br />
• 1GB DDR3<br />
• microSD card slot (bootable)<br />
• 128Mb write protected SPI flash<br />
• External frequency reference input for realtime applications.<br />
• Onboard 32.768KHz and 100MHz oscillators.<br />
• 38 pairs of 1.5V GPIO over two flex cable breakout headers ~ 7.6Gbps @ 200MHz.<br />
• Open source design including gerber files, manufacturing specifications, BOM and source list.<br />

Applications
============

• Libre SoC development. Bitstreams for RISC-V and OpenSPARC will be available.<br />
• Hardware Security Module (HSM).<br />
• Authentication tokens.<br />
• Verifiable encrypted storage with cascade blockciphers and isolated PIN entry.<br />
• Cryptographic acceleration.<br />
• Cryptocurrency / bitcoin wallet.<br />
• Software defined radio.<br />
• Research into evolvable hardware and hardware accelerated machine learning.<br />
