# aggregate-1

The aggregate-1 is a general purpose FPGA development platform for designs that require both a large fabric and high speed interconnect. The miniPCIe interface allows operation with most laptops, embedded small board computers and routers. 

Features;

• Xilinx Spartan 6 LX150T<br />
• 1GB DDR3<br />
• microSD card slot<br />
• External frequency reference input enables realtime applications.<br />
• Onboard 32.768KHz and 100MHz oscillators<br />
• 38 pairs of 1.5V GPIO over two flex cable breakout headers ~ 7.6Gbps @ 200MHz<br />
• Open source design including gerber files, manufacturing specifications, BOM and source list.<br />

Suggested applications;

• Libre SoC development. Bitstreams for RISC-V and OpenSPARC will be available.<br />
• Custom Hardware Security Modules and cryptographic accelerators.<br />
• Software defined radio.<br />
• Research into evolvable hardware and hardware accelerated machine learning.<br />

This project intends to lower the cost to entry for sophisticated high speed digital design and is a collaboration between Numato Lab and Polysome.
