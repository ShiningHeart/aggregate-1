# aggregate-1

The aggregate-1 is a general purpose FPGA development platform for designs that require both a large fabric and high speed interconnect. The miniPCIe interface allows operation with most laptops, embedded small board computers and routers. 

Features

9.6 Gbps throughput
Xilinx Spartan 6 LX100T or LX150T
1GB DDR3 
External frequency reference input to enable development of realtime applications. Onboard 32.768KHz and 100MHz oscillators.
38 pairs of 1.5V GPIO over two flex cable breakout headers - 7.6Gbps @ 200MHz.
Open source design including gerber files, manufacturing specifications, BOM and source list.

Suggested use cases;

Open source SoC development. GPLv3 bitstreams for RISC-V and OpenSPARC will be made available.
Custom Hardware Security Modules and cryptographic accelerators.
Software defined radio. A daughterboard is in development with a 100MHz RX and 250MHz TX channel bandwidth from 25MHz-6GHz.
Research into evolvable hardware and hardware accelerated machine learning.

This project intends to lower the cost to entry for sophisticated high speed digital design and is a collaboration between Numato Lab and Polysome.
